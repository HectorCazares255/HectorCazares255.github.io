### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs because it's where my coding journey began. This was my first time editing code and I didn't know that it could be pretty simple if you knew what you're doing. This activity was a pretty memorable one for me.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 is another one of my favorite coding project because it was a pretty simple task that was given for us to code. It's pretty memorable because I overcomplicated it with more code than necessary The end result was much more simple and neat compared to what I initially had.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 is another one of my favorite labs because it introduced a word game that I ever heard the name of. What's more is that it was one of my first coding projects where I knew what to do. Moreover, it was pretty satisfying seeing the end result of my code and playing around with it.
